### General Information

This app was developed during the summer semester of 2024 in the course "Ausgew√§hlte Projekte der Informatik." The goal was to develop an Android app that helps users document and archive their own planting and harvesting activities, as well as connect with fellow gardening enthusiasts. The GUI of the app is in German.

The app is divided into sections using a _BottomBar_ layout. The functions for documenting the growth of your plants are found in the _Journal_ and _Pflanzen_ sections, where users can document the growth of their plants. In the _Pflanzen_ section, a predefined plant profile can be selected and added to the "Journal" (the inventory). These plant profiles also provide useful tips on plant care.

The _Gartenfreunde_ tab covers the app's social media functionality. Here, users can register with an email address, password, and nickname. After registration, users can create posts and follow other users to see their posts.

### Project Structure

The folder [snapshots](./snapshots/) contains images of the gui development. The folder [assets](./assets/) contains the assets added to the app. In [pubspec.yaml](./pubspec.yaml) all dependencies can be found. The main code is in the folder [lib](./lib/). All other folders are automatically generated by flutter and should be ignored.
